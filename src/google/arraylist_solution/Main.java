/*

Implement a restaurant waitlist data structure. It should support the following features:
1. A party of customers can join the waitlist.
2. A previously joined party can leave the waitlist at any time.
3. The restaurant serves teh first party whose size fits the empty table size at a time ( a table size
is given as an argument)

-> correct solution
-> run time complexity also matters
